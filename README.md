## Problem

There are many cybersecurity certifications on the market but most of them are tailored toward proprietary tools and are cost prohibitive. There are many people that want to enter the cybersecurity space however they lack the time and resources to afford many of the proprietary tests on the market. Also many certification exams are not hands on which leave employees skeptical of hiring certified but technically unproven candidates.

## Solution

Create an open source, peer reviewed certification that allows candidates to attain an entry level certification and prove cybersecurity technical competence.
